# Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow

In this repository, you will find the projects that I carried out for the "Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow" Udacity Nanodegree program.

Python version: 3.5.5

Each folder contains a project, its Anaconda environment and its deliverables. Note that the data that are used, as well as some necessary functions are missing and thus, the notebooks cannot be reproduced.

## Project 1 - Finding Donors for CharityML

In this project, the student has to implement several supervised learning algorithms and answer certain questions related to the task of classifying individuals to two classes; those that earn more than $50,000 and those that do not. This would help CharityML, a fictitious charity organization, determine where to send letters asking for donations, given that the previous experience has shown that only individuals with an annual income larger than $50,000 actually make donations. I personally implement and evaluate three classifiers: 

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Gradient Boosting 

Moreover, the Gradient Boosting classifier which proved to have the best performance (in terms of F-score and accuracy) is fine-tuned using a grid search of some of its hyper-parameters. Additional information can be found in the Jupyter notebook.
